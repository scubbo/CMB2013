<h2>How to apply for tickets: </h2>

<p>Ticketing applications will be open to Clare students for one week, from <strong>6pm on February 8th, until 6pm on February 15th</strong>. This will be though the website <a href="http://www.claremayball.com">http://www.claremayball.com</a>.</p>

<p>During this time, Clare students may apply for tickets for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Themselves</li>
<li>A priority guest</li>
<li>Two further guests</li>
</ul>
 
<p>After ticketing has closed, tickets will be allocated first to Clare students, followed by their priority guests in order of application. Once  priority guest tickets have been allocated, remaining tickets will be allocated to the 2nd and 3rd guests in pairs, again in order of application. It is therefore unlikely that every Clare student will receive tickets for all three of their nominated guest before we sell out of tickets. After all tickets are allocated, a waiting list will be held for tickets if they become available at a later date. If we do not, however, sell out within this week, applications will be re-opened to the university at a later date.</p>
  
<p>You may apply for guests from outside of Cambridge, but if applying for guests from other Cambridge colleges, please include the CRSid with their application or they will be charged at the external rate. Each successful applicant will be given a unique registration code, necessary for collection of wristband and entry to the ball:</p>
 
<p><strong>PLEASE MAKE A NOTE OF THIS NUMBER.</strong></p>
 
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> You may not be able to alter your application after you have submitted it, so take care when applying. You may, however, upgrade your ticket to a VIP ticket it a later date if you wish to do so, subject to availability.</p>
 
<p>Name changes are available up until shortly before the ball, however a fee of &pound;35 will be applied.</p>
 
<p><strong>Any questions or issues, contact <a href="mailto:ticketing@claremayball.com">ticketing@claremayball.com</strong></a>.
 
<p>We reserve the right to refuse entry or reject an application.</p>
