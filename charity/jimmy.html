	<p>Jimmy's Cambridge welcomes 20 men and women who would otherwise be homeless, providing emergency accommodation and full support services. Our main aim is to find our guests suitable, sustainable accommodation. This cannot be achieved without addressing the underlying issues that brought a person to homelessness so we have a team that provides specialisms in eg alcohol, substance misuse, mental health, ex-armed forces and counselling. We work with visiting specialists eg nurse, HIV/Hep workers, drug and alcohol recovery teams and the Samaritans.</p>

	<p>We also offer a range of activities that help our guests to rediscover and build practical and life skills. Additionally we provide opportunities for guests to be involved in how the service is run through the guest forum and service delivery group and input into policies and procedures.</p>

	<p>Jimmy's is a place where guests can regain and maintain their self-respect and work their way back into society at large.</p>
