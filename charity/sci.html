	<h1>SCI</h1>

	<img class="charityImage" src="/img/charity/SCI.jpg" >

	<p>SCI delivers treatment against the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) schistosomiasis (bilharzia) and soil-transmitted helminths (worms), that affect over 500 million of the poorest people on earth. If left untreated these diseases cause stunted growth, disfigurement, chronic disability and an early death. They prevent children from going to school and adults from earning a living, trapping these communities in perpetual poverty.</p>

	<p>SCI is part of the School of Public Health, Imperial College London, and with support from several donors has already helped 12 countries treat over 100 million people with safe, cheap and effective drugs, supplied in partnership with the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
 
	<p>SCI is ranked one of the most cost-effective charities by two independent charity evaluators, <a href="www.givewell.org">www.givewell.org</a> and <a href="www.givingwhatwecan.org">www.givingwhatwecan.org</a>. This is because for every 50p raised SCI guarantees that at least one child receives the annual treatment needed to combat these NTDs, ensuring they have a more promising, healthier and happier future.</p>
