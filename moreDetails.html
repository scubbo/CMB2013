				<h2>Workers Section</h2>
				<p>For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Computer, lights up! Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral.</p>

				<h2>Tickets Section</h2>
				<p>Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing?</p>

			<div id="actsWheelContent" class="wheelContent" data-wheel-position=2>
				<h2>Acts Section</h2>
				<p>I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Sorry, Data. I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="contactsWheelContent" class="wheelContent" data-wheel-position=3>
				<h2>Contacts Section</h2>
				<p>Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'?</p>
			</div>
			<div id="vipWheelContent" class="wheelContent" data-wheel-position=4>
				<h2>VIP Section</h2>
				<p>In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. I am your worst nightmare! Damage report! You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="galleryWheelContent" class="wheelContent" data-wheel-position=5>
				<h2>Gallery Section</h2>
				<p>I'll be sure to note that in my log. You enjoyed that. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. and attack the Romulans. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? Wouldn't that bring about chaos? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation.</p>
